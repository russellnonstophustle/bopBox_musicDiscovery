## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Vite, Tailwind, and Axios to integrate the powerful Shazam core API

Building the music discovery app using the instructions from the JavaScript Mastery course was an amazing learning experience for me, and it challenged me to problem-solve and think critically when issues arose. While integrating the Shazam core API, I discovered that the endpoint I was using had been deprecated, so I had to dive into the documentation and find the new endpoints to get it to work correctly. Despite this setback, the step-by-step instructions provided by the course were clear and easy to follow, and I was able to learn a lot about the React framework and Vite bundler during the process. By utilizing the Shazam API, I was able to create a powerful and user-friendly app that I am extremely proud of. Overall, this project has been an invaluable learning experience for me and has helped me take my React skills to the next level

## Optimizations

User authentication and personalized content: Implementing user authentication could allow for personalized content and recommendations, based on users' listening history and preferences. This could enhance the user experience and increase engagement.

Social sharing: Allowing users to share their favorite songs or playlists on social media platforms could increase user engagement and virality, resulting in increased app usage.

Integration with other services: Integrating the app with other music streaming services such as Spotify or Apple Music could expand the app's capabilities and increase its usefulness to a wider audience.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. Here are a couple of mine:

Stay up-to-date with API documentation: APIs can change over time, and it's important to stay aware of any updates or changes that may affect the functionality of the app. In my case, the Shazam core API had deprecated a specific endpoint, which required me to update the code to use the new endpoints.

File/Folder Structure: You just have to appreciate the folder structure that the JavaScript Mastery course uses and teaches, it really doesn't get any better.
